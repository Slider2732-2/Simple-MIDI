# mini-Piano-MIDI
Simple method to convert toy piano type keyboards to MIDI 

See this video: 

The method is very straighforward, with code that can be easily debugged and is easy to read. 
It is quick enough with a standard Arduino Nano to offer full polyphony and little latency.
Full optimisation could include clever routines for the keyboard matrix and additions such as pitch bend, modulation, octave shifting, function keys and more. This codebase is intended to help people start off on such roads  :)
